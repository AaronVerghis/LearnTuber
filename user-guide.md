# LearnTuber User Guide

As per 27 Feb 2023 the website is not deployed becasue of server side limitations but in future we are looking to update it and deploy the complete web app.
As if now please host client and server it on your system.

## Step 1

Clone the repostory in your system.

## Step 2

Locate the local repo and run two terminals in client and server directory of the repo.

## Step 3

Run "npm install" on both server and client terminal. ( Make sure you have Node.js installed in your system for the following command to run)

## Step 4

Run "npm run serve" on server side terminal. (If you get any error try running "npm install nodemon")

## Step 5

Run "npm run dev" on client side terminal.

## Step 6

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5173/ to open client side page.

## Step 7

Add YouTube URL (recommended to choose a short video to decrease processing time) in the input box and press summarize button and wait for few minutes.

## Step 8

The requested output would be available on the webpage as well as server terminal would have requested URL, converted audio URL, transcribed text, summarized text and quiz in proper format.
In case of any errors in server side terminal like "unauthorized API key" please refer to [developer-guide](https://github.com/NirbhaySirsikar/LearnTuber/blob/main/developer-guide.md).
